  instructions: 'Preheat oven to 450 F. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a cookie sheet. Wash the potatoes until they are clean. Put the potatoes in a pot and fill with water. Add about 2 tablespoons of salt to the water. Place the water on a medium high flame and bring to a boil. Boil them until they are tender all the way through. Make sure a fork pierces them easily. Drain the potatoes. Let the potatoes cool a little. Drizzle the cookie sheet with olive oil. Place the cooked potatoes on cookie sheet.\n'
    + '\n'
    + "Using a small paring knife, make an X cut on the top of each potato so it's easier to crush them. Use a potato masher and gently press on each potato until squashed but not disintegrated. You want them to stay together. If they fall apart, don't worry! Just pick up the bits into piles and keep going.\n"
    + '\n'
    + "Once smashed, generously sprinkle kosher salt over each potato. Follow with pepper, and then, drizzle them with more olive oil. If desired, sprinkle each potato with freshly chopped rosemary or chives if desired. Sprinkle with smoked paprika to finish them off if desired. Bake the potatoes at 450 F for 20-25 minutes, longer is better, you want them very crisp, just don't let them burn. Serve hot!",
